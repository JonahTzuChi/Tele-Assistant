# Credit
This project is greatly inspired by [/father-bot/chatgpt_telegram_bot](https://github.com/father-bot/chatgpt_telegram_bot), many nicely written code blocks were borrowed from there.
One way to tell the different between two projects is the former is powered by chat-completion model and this project is powered by Assistant-API.
